# Treatment with series result files  
This is to treat a series of result files based on *Python* with mainly *Pandas* and *Numpy*  
Specially, if dataframe in *Pandas* has only one series, the dataframe would reduce its dimension and some instructions based on dataframe would be no more effective. Thus it should be condidered.
